A tool to parse an arbitrarily large JSON file into a Microsoft SQL Server database.

The tool will verify the fields specified exists in the database table, then processes the file concurrently by
creating blocks of JSON objects then passing them to a thread executor.

The tool uses its 'best effort' to perform the import, i.e. it will:

* Continue to read the JSON array if it encounters an non-object
* Assign null value if a field that is missing in a JSON object
* Assign default value if the JSON value type is not compatible with the database field
* Continues if it encounters an exception when importing an object

The tool will import the first array it finds in the JSON file, i.e. the array can be nested inside objects or come
after other fields in the file. It will skip any nodes in the array that is not an object.

For example, if the import table's field type is correct, the tool will import the 'auctions' array in the
following text without errors:

    {
    "realm":{"name":"Aegwynn","slug":"aegwynn"},
    "alliance":{"auctions":[
    {"auc":2073382230,"item":[1, 2, 3],"owner":"Keely"},
    "random string",
    {"auc":2073949971,"item":52364,"owner":"Facepwnded"},
    {"auc":2073218804,"item":23107,"owner":"Tephelie"}]}
    }
    }

Note when using SQL Server with named instances:

Microsoft SQL Server defaults to listen on port 1433, but a named instance will listen on a different port. This can
be found by looking at the SQL Server log file in SQL Server Management Studio > Management > SQL Server Logs.
Look for something like `Server is listening on [ 'any' <ipv4> 56866]`. In this case, 56866 is the port number.

Alternatively, one can start the SQL Server Browser service, which listens on port 1434. Connections to port 1434
will get redirected to the correct SQL Server port.

The tool uses the following third party packages:

    commons-cli-1.2.jar            Apache Commons CLI for parsing command line options.
    jackson-core-2.2.0.jar         Jackson JSON Processor for parsing JSON file.
    jackson-annotations-2.2.0.jar
    jackson-databind-2.2.0
    jtds-1.3.1.jar                 jTDS JDBC Driver for connecting to Microsoft SQL Server.
